    <h2 style="color: hwb(93 4% 42%);"">Early Life and Education</h2>
    <p>
      Born Narendranath Dutta, into an affluent Bengali family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was one of the eight children of Vishwanath Dutta and Bhuvaneshwari Devi.
       He was born on January 12, 1863, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. Father Vishwanath was a successful attorney with considerable influence in society. 
       Narendranath’s mother Bhuvaneshwari was a woman endowed with a strong, God-fearing mind who had a great impact on her son. 
      <br>
      As a young boy, Narendranath displayed sharp intellect. His mischievous nature belied his interest in music, both instrumental as well as vocal. He excelled in 
      his studies as well, first at the Metropolitan institution, and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. By the time he graduated from the college, he had 
      acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects. He was active in sports, gymnastics, wrestling and body building. He was an avid reader and read up on almost 
      everything under the sun. He perused the Hindu scriptures like the Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads on one hand, while on the other hand he studied western philosophy, 
      history and spirituality by David Hume, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Herbert Spencer.

    <h2 style="color: #ff0000;">Death</h2>
    <p>On 4 July 1902, Swami Vivekananda died while in a state of meditation after living his day like any other 
      and teaching his followers and discussing the teachings with Vedic Scholars. Went to his room in the Ramakrishna Math, 
      the monastery he built in honor of his Guru to meditate and breathe his last. His followers believed the cause of death 
      to be the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain that happens when one attains nirvana, the highest form of spiritual 
      enlightenment when the 7th chakra that is the crown chakra which is located on the head opens and then gains maha samadhi 
      while meditating. The time of his death was 9:20 pm. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the banks of the Ganga 
      opposite his guru.</p>
